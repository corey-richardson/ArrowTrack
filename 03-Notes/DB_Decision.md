As I am using a lot of parent-child relational objects, SQL may be the better design choice here. However, with the limited deadline it may be worth using JSON as a starting point and moving over to SQL as a low priority item.

It may be worth looking into PostgreSQL to see if this would be an appropriate framework to use.
