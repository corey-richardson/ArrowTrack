/* There was originally a function "getAllChildren()" which I created in hopes it would handle
the file i/o for both view.js and calculateValue.js (D.R.Y). I couldn't get it to work.

The Fetch API above which is used to read the file, returns a 'Promise' that it will provide
the data and not the data itself; asynchronous. 

This meant that the program would continue to run into sections requiring the data before the
data had actually been provided. For example:

const viewElements = getAllChildren();
let length = viewElements.length;
// etc...
// viewElements would be 'undefined' and would not have a 'length' attribute yet.

To get around this, I have now removed the getAllChildren() function and moved the logic
requiring the data into '.then()' blocks. This does introduce repitition of code but... :)
