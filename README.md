## Project Vision

> This project could be used by archers and archery clubs to track and help maintain the equipment they hold. This would also be useful to track the value of the inventory to assist in insurance calculations, and track the items that may need replacing to help with budgeting.

---

## Project Overview

As an archer and club committee member myself, I recognised the need for a tool that could be
easily used to track owned items and their conditions for the purpose of maintenance and
budget allocation for replacement equipment, for both individuals and clubs within the archery
community, or even other sports communities.

ArrowTrack was designed with the goal of addressing these needs.

For individuals, the application provides a tool to monitor the condition of their equipment,
ensuring longevity and performance, thus saving money in the long term on damages. For clubs
where club-owned equipment can be spread across multiple indoor and outdoor ranges, or on
loan out to club members trialling different bow setups, the ArrowTrack tool can be used to
manage this in one centralised tool. ArrowTrackâ€™s total cost and by-location cost functionalities
can be especially helpful to club treasurers and equipment officers, assisting in insurance
estimations and budget planning.

## Using the Application

1. When first opening the single-page application, there will be no items in the database to display.

![SPA with no items to display](/08-Report/readme-res/01-empty_view.png)

2. To add an item, fill out the 'Add a New Item' form with the relevant item information and **Submit**.

![](/08-Report/readme-res/02-AddForm_filled.png)

![](/08-Report/readme-res/03-AddForm_submitted.png)

3. If there are items stored in multiple locations, the combined total value of all items, and the values of items seperated by storage location are displayed.

4. To update an item, select it in the *Item to Edit* field of the 'Edit an Existing Item'. Complete the form fields you wish to update with the updated values and **Submit**.

5. The 'Check Out this item?', 'Remove this item?' and 'Update Condition' (Option: 'Unsafe') fields have special behaviour.

'Check Out this item?'
- A truthy value for this field will change the CSS styling for this items container, allowing the user/club member to visually identifier which items are not currently available for use.
- ![](/08-Report/readme-res/07-CheckOut_filled.png)
- ![](/08-Report/readme-res/08-CheckOut_submitted.png)

'Remove this item?'
- A truthy value for this field will remove the item from the database on submission.
- ![](/08-Report/readme-res/09-Remove_filled.png)
- ![](/08-Report/readme-res/10-Remove_submitted.png)

'Update Condition' (Option: 'Unsafe')
- A truthy value for this field will change the CSS styling for this items container, allowing the user/club member to visually identifier which items are not currently safe for use.
- A Club Equipment Officer can use this attribute to identify items in dire need of repair or replacement.

## Responsive Web Design

The application utilises Flexboxes to cater to a variety of screen sizes. This ensures content is usable, readable and accessible on all platforms.

                       signal / low bandwidth. This allows all dependencies to
                       be installed even when the user hasn't already got an
